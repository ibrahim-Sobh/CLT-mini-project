# Central Limit Theorem mini-project
The idea is to write a piece of Python code to check that the Central Limit Theorem works wiht any probability distribution.
This project is testing the CLT on Binomial, Poisson, Exponential and Discreet uniform Distributions.

- First version is using Pycharm found under CTL.py (Class)
- Second version is using Jupyter Notebook (CentralLimitTheorem-mini-project.ipynb)

# Conclusion:

- At the end we can see that the central Limit Theorem works with any kind of distribution,and it is a way for us to normalize our data and transform it into something useful That we can use in our machine learning algorithms.
- The more Samples we take the more similar our distribution comes to a normal distribution.
