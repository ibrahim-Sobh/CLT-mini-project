# Central Limit Theorem mini-project
The idea is to write a piece of Python code to check that the Central Limit Theorem works wiht any probability distribution.
This project is testing the CLT on Binomial, Poisson, and Discreet Distributions.

- first version is using Pycharm found under CTL.py (Class)
- second version is using Jupyter Notebook (CentralLimitTheorem-mini-project.ipynb)
