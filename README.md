# CentralLimitTheorem-mini-project
The idea is to write a piece of Python code to check that the Central Limit Theorem works wiht any probability distribution.
For simplicity this project is using the Binomial Distribution.

- first version is using Pycharm found under CTL.py (Class)
- second version is using Jupyter Notebook (CentralLimitTheorem-mini-project.ipynb)
